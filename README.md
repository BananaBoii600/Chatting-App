A simple chatting app made with socket's in python.

The code is clean and can be easily edited

I Recommend everyone to play around with the code and gui and understand it.

The app uses uses socket's to run the server

The clients use tkinter for gui

# Important Instructions

**To allow other users who do not use your internet router to join, you must port forward your ip address and change the `HOST` variables in the server file and in the client file to your ip, if you are not sure where to find your ip after port forwarding, click [this](https://www.whatismyip.com/)**

If you are not sure how to port forward, I recommend you see some youtube tutorials on how to do so

If you are not interested in port forwarding, you may use [hamachi](https://vpn.net/) or other softwares like it to allow users from other routers to join your server.

# Setup

Before you install the app, make sure your [python](https://www.python.org/downloads) and [pip](https://pypi.org/) is up to date

Make sure you also have tkinter installed in your computer, tkinter can be installed by entering the command given below in the command prompt/terminal

```sh
pip install tk
```

After installing python and tkinter, download the latest release and start the server.

After running the server, you can open the client app and start chatting with your friends(***AFTER PORT FORWARDING***)

# Thank you for downloading
